# Exoscale CLI

Manage your Exoscale infrastructure easily from the command-line with `exo`.


## Installation

### Using pre-built releases (recommended)

You can find pre-built releases of the CLI [here][releases].


### From sources

To build `exo` from sources, a Go compiler >= 1.13 is required.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/exoscale/cli
$ cd cli
$ git submodule update --init --recursive go.mk
$ make build
```

Upon successful compilation, the resulting `exo` binary is stored in the `bin/` directory.


## Configuration

Running the `exo config` command will guide you through the initial configuration.

You can create and find API credentials in the *IAM* section of the [Exoscale Console](https://portal.exoscale.com/iam/api-keys).

The configuration file and all assets created during `exo` operations will be saved in the following location:

| OS | Location |
|:--|:--|
| GNU/Linux, *BSD | `$HOME/.config/exoscale/` |
| macOS | `$HOME/Library/Application Support/exoscale/` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\.exoscale\` |

The configuration parameters are then saved in a `exoscale.toml` file with the following minimum format:

```
defaultaccount = "account_name"

[[accounts]]
  account = "account_name"
  endpoint = "https://api.exoscale.com/v1"
  key = "API_KEY"
  name = "account_name"
  secret = "API_SECRET"
```

The current configuration and configuration file path can be shown with `exo config show`.

## Usage

The `exo` CLI contains documentation for all of its commands, you can explore them by running `exo help`.
Additional information and tutorials are available [on Exoscale's community website][communitydoc].
