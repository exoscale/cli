# Egoscale v3 (Alpha)

**Egoscale v3** is based on a generator written from scratch with [libopenapi](https://github.com/pb33f/libopenapi).

The core base of the generator is using libopenapi to parse and read the [Exoscale OpenAPI spec](https://openapi-v2.exoscale.com/source.yaml) and then generate the code from it.

## Generate Egoscale v3

From the root repo
```Bash
make generate
